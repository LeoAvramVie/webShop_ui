My Personal Experience with the "Start Coding Like The Biggest Software Companies in The World!" Tutorial

I recently completed this fantastic tutorial on building a full web application using the MEAN stack, which covers MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js. I found the hands-on approach to learning incredibly engaging, as it allowed me to work on a real-world project while acquiring essential skills in various technologies.

The frontend technologies I learned include Angular 15, NX Monorepo, PrimeNg Material Library, RXJS, NGRX for User Session, and SCSS. On the backend, I gained valuable knowledge about Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens). The course also provided a solid introduction to server-side web development, teaching me the basics of building Angular apps, styling layouts, and calling an HTTP API from my app.

One of the highlights of this tutorial was the step-by-step guidance on building an e-shop app and admin panel from scratch. I learned about product and user management, handling carts, product filtering, login and authentication, and more. Moreover, I appreciated the insights on deploying my application to production servers and utilizing external libraries.

By the end of the course, I had developed a fully functional e-commerce Angular app that I could use as a foundation for future projects or customize to fit my specific needs. This tutorial was an excellent learning experience for me as a web developer interested in the MEAN stack, and I highly recommend it to others seeking to expand their skills in full-stack, frontend, or backend web development.
